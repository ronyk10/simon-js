                    <p>Objective: The player must move all the crates or objects in the level to their target locations
                        to
                        complete the level. <br>

                        <br> Moves: The player can move the main character (usually represented by a character or an
                        object)
                        to
                        push the crates in four directions (up, down, left, right). Crates can only be pushed if the
                        space
                        in front of them is clear.<br>

                        <br> Obstacles: The player must avoid obstacles such as walls or other objects that can block
                        the
                        movements of the crates or the main character.<br>

                        <br>Target locations: The crates must be moved to specific target locations on the game board.
                        Once
                        all
                        the crates are correctly placed on the target locations, the level is considered successful.<br>

                        <br>Have fun !<br>
